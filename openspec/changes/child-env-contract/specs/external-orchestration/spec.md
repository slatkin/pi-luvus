## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Role resolution
`start` SHALL resolve a role name with the same lookup the extension uses: the `.pi/agents/` directory of the child's working directory, then the global agents directory (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, or `~/.pi/agent`, followed by `agents/`), then the package's `agents/`. The first file that exists wins. It SHALL use the frontmatter `model`, `thinking` and `tools` fields, the `auto-exit` flag, the `spawning` flag and the `deny-tools` list, and the body as the appended system prompt. The child SHALL get the same denied tools that a pi-parent launch of the same role gives. Role files with LF or CRLF line endings SHALL parse the same way. An unknown role, or a role whose `model` is empty, MUST fail before a pane is split.

#### Scenario: Auto-exit role
- **WHEN** the resolved role's frontmatter has `auto-exit: true`
- **THEN** the child runs with `PI_LUVUS_AUTO_EXIT=1`

#### Scenario: Control tools always present
- **WHEN** the role's `tools` list omits `luvus_done`
- **THEN** the child's `--tools` still includes `caller_ping`, `luvus_done` and `luvus_message`

#### Scenario: Role denies spawning
- **WHEN** the resolved role's frontmatter has `spawning: false`
- **THEN** the child runs with `PI_DENY_TOOLS` naming `luvus_spawn`, `luvus_interrupt`, `luvus_list` and `luvus_resume`

#### Scenario: Role denies listed tools
- **WHEN** the resolved role's frontmatter has `deny-tools: claude` and no `spawning` line
- **THEN** the child runs with `PI_DENY_TOOLS=claude`

#### Scenario: Role denies nothing
- **WHEN** the resolved role has no `spawning` line and no `deny-tools` line
- **THEN** the child's env has no `PI_DENY_TOOLS`

#### Scenario: Unknown role
- **WHEN** no role file matches the given role name
- **THEN** `start` exits non-zero naming the role and the paths searched, and splits no pane

#### Scenario: Empty model
- **WHEN** the role's frontmatter has `model:` with no value, followed by other fields
- **THEN** `start` exits non-zero saying the role has an empty model, and splits no pane

#### Scenario: CRLF role file
- **WHEN** the role file uses CRLF line endings
- **THEN** its model, tools, auto-exit flag, spawning flag, deny-tools list and body resolve the same as the LF version
